# Introduction
##Version 0.0.0.1

Nowadays it is possible to embed RDF in Turtle [1], however it is not easy to see if there is RDF in a page. Inspired by Crowbar [2], I created a tool that displays the triples available in Turtle format. Just copy the link to your bookmarks and click on it whenever you are in a page with turtle embedded. turtle-in-html uses Masahide Kanzaki's excellent Turtle parser [3], and show the triples in the page.
